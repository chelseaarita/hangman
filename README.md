# hangman
For my final project at Hackbright's prep course, I chose to write hangman. It was challenging and difficult. Originally I started off with a function but I scratched that and now I'm using a while loop. I think I made this code more complicated than it really is because I overthink way too much.<p>
My class was from 10/31/2017 to 12/21/2017.
